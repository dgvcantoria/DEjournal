## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Difference between ETL (saves storage) and ELT (saves all data that can be viewed again) and why one is used over the other
- dlt speeds up loading of data from set up codes
- Clickhouse is an example of database with the following features: high performance, column-oriented, OLAP
- Structured data are in spreadsheet format
- Unstructured data can be anything that is column-based like emails, pictures, videos
- Semistructured are usually in Json format

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- ETL - Extract Transform Load
- ELT - Extract Load Transform
- dlt - data load tool
- dbt - data build tool
- Clickhouse - an example of a database
- OLAP - Online Analytics Processing
- OLTP - Online Transactional Processing
- Sandbox - an extra database and safe space used for experiments

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- 

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- 

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
